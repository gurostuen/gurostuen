### Hello, I'm Guro 👋


I am pursuing a master's degree in microbiology at the University of Bergen👩‍🔬, and I am currently learning about GitHub and 
reproducible data analysis techniques. My goal is to use GitHub thoroughly to document my journey and progress as I work
towards completing my master's thesis.
